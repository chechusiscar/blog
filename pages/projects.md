- [`bible-pptx`](https://biblepptx.chechu.co) - Originally developed as a utility to automate a portion of my own Bible study preparation, this app allows you to turn your notes with verse references (e.g.&nbsp;`Genesis 1:1-3`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`Jn 14:6`) into presentation files with the verse text. Watch out: Currently takes up to 1 min to load as it is hosted for free on Render.
- [`mcfc`](https://chechu.co/mcfc) - A tool to create multiple-choice flashcards more efficiently. Based on the Python script I used to convert dumps of multiple-choice questions into a format that can be imported easily into Quizlet.
- [This blog](https://blog.chechu.co) and [main site](https://chechu.co) - Static websites hosted for free on GitHub Pages - finally got used to `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` in the process 😉 Blog migrated from Ghost CMS (great, but costs money to host) to the Jekyll static-site generator in 2024.
