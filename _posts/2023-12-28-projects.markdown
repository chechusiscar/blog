- [`bible-pptx`](https://biblepptx.chechu.co) - Originally developed as a utility to automate a portion of my own Bible study preparation, this app allows you to turn your notes with verse references (e.g.&nbsp;`Genesis 1:1-3`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`Jn 14:6`) into presentation files with the verse text.
- [`mcfc`](https://chechu.co/mcfc) - A tool to create multiple-choice flashcards more efficiently. Based on the Python script I used to convert dumps of multiple-choice questions into a format that can be imported easily into Quizlet.
