_Snippets from my handwritten devotional notes_

## Favorite insights

- Fame and worldly renown are not a Christian's goals (Luke 4:6-8; Luke 6:26)
  - Therefore, Christian service should never be about contests of fame or importance (Luke 22:24-27)
  - The heart of a true preacher: Christ is much greater and more wonderful than me (Luke 3:15-16)
- Jesus felt a burden to fulfill his destiny — in turn, in some sense, we need to feel a burden to fulfill his will for our life (Luke 12:50)
- Relationships should not be built on the basis of creating _utang na loob_ (Luke 14:12).
- The lack of value creation even if capital is preserved is wicked (Luke 19:20-23)
- A righteous person lives awaiting the coming of the Kingdom of God (Luke 23:51; Luke 21:34-36)

- Lord, help me to be faithful with a little so you would bless me with much more, and as you bless me, may my eyes always be on the blesser rather than the blessing (Luke 16:10-11)
- Lord, may my faith not fail — let me always find myself coming back to you (Luke 22:32)
