Happy New Year!

Today, I was quite sentimental while constructing the timeline below with key events and milestones, which was pieced from photos and calendar entries from 2023. Definitely not an exhaustive list ‚Äî since I don't always take pictures or schedule _everything_ ‚Äî but good enough to recap the past year.

I really felt that this was a meaningful exercise that more people should try. Here are three insights I'd like to share:

**Keeping a calendar is a game changer.** This was the first year I religiously stuck to a calendar, partly inspired by **_[redacted]_** who would always check her calendar before saying "yes" to a commitment. More than allowing me to offload important events and tasks from my brain, my calendar also serves a lasting record for myself of how I've spent my time.

**I want to explore new experiences and document them.** Several friends pointed out how I have more of a social life now compared to when I was still in college. It was really fun to hang out, eat, and _chika_ with people, some of whom I've not met personally in years. As a bonus, I was able to try a few new restaurants as well. But as I've shared with my closest friends, maybe we can try more new experiences aside from eating this year? Perhaps, I can limit food pictures to less than 50% of my photo library in 2024! üòÇ

**There's so much to be grateful for.** Sure, not everything ended up like I hoped. Some goals were not achieved. Some relationships fizzled out. Some days were downright depressing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the comfort and support of my constants. I saw unexpected opportunities open up for me. There were moments of bliss amidst this chaotic life.

Looking back into 2023, I echo the lyrics of [this song by Legacy Five](https://youtu.be/730_Smc5nT0):

> Though I've had my own share of hard times  
> I wouldn't change things if I could  
> 'Cause through it all, God's been good
