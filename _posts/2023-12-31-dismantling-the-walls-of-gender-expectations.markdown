## The prevalence of gender stereotypes is a social problem

## Gender norms in the Philippines are still far from progressive

Most respondents agree that…

- Men are better leaders because they are less emotional and more decisive than women
- The husband should take on the role as the primary breadwinner in the household
- Women should take care of the different chores inside the home and perform care work

## Rigid gender roles are already impressed upon children at a young age

## Stereotypes limit the individuality of the person and contribute to societal inequalities

- **People become who they’re not**
  - People with certain interests or personalities that defy social expectations given their gender may choose to suppress or change their identity to avoid being ridiculed
- **People get discriminated against**
  - People in fields that are dominated by the other gender might not be afforded the same level of opportunities (e.g., women who are interested in STEM or male caregivers/household help)
- **People face mental health issues**
  - People who are forced to conform to a certain gender stereotype just to be accepted by society may end up experiencing certain mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression

## Gender stereotypes are incompatible with the message of the Gospel

- **The Gospel teaches that all people are equal at the foot of the cross**

> **Galatians 3:28 NLT**   
> There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.

- **Even the ministry gifts and responsibilities which were largely male-dominated in the Old Testament are now available to all**

> **Acts 2:17 NIV**  
> “‘In the last days, God says,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will pour out my Spirit on all people.  
> Your&nbsp; **sons and daughters&nbsp;** will prophesy,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your young men will see visions,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your old men will dream dreams.

## All of us can take simple steps towards gender inclusiveness

- **Use language consciously**
  - **Avoid the use of gendered pronouns** (he/she) in favor of the gender-neutral they, particularly if gender is not pertinent to the conversation
  - **Choose gender-neutral alternatives** to gendered nouns (e.g., police officer instead of policeman, business owner instead of businessman)
  - **Stop using sexist expressions** which impose behavioral expectations based on gender (e.g., instead of teaching someone to “be a man,” teach them to “be human”)
- **Challenge gender expectations**
  - **Explore different career paths, hobbies. and interests** which are typically associated with the opposite gender
  - **Embrace one’s personality** even if it goes against stereotypes
  - **Maintain close personal relationships with everyone,** not just people of the same gender
- **Advocate for systemic change**
  - **Advocate for equal treatment across societal institutions,** including the implementation of equal maternity and paternity leaves which would (1) avoid discrimination against women due to the benefit cost and (2) promote equal distribution of household responsibilities
  - **Stand up for people** who are ridiculed or criticized just for breaking stereotypical expectations based on gender

**These small steps can lead to the progressive breakdown of gender stereotypes in our circles.** With enough people taking these actions, gender inclusiveness will cascade to the rest of society.
